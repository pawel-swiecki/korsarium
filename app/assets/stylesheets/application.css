/*
* CUBE CSS Architecture for Rails with Propshaft
* This is the main manifest file that imports all CSS in the correct order

* Order matters for the cascade:
* 1. Reset and base styles
* 2. Design tokens (CSS custom properties)
* 3. Global styles
* 4. Utility classes
* 5. Compositions (layout patterns)
* 6. Blocks (components)
* 7. Utility overrides
